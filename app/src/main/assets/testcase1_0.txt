(A) One of the most interesting forms of insect behavior is exhibited by the
social insects, which, unlike the majority of insect species, live in organized
groups. The social insects include wasps, bees, and ants. Characteristically an
insect society is formed of a parent or parents and a large number of
offspring. The individual members of the society are divided into groups, each
having a specialized function and often exhibiting markedly different bodily
structures.
B) Research is hard work, but like any challenging job well done, both the
process and the results bring immense personal satisfaction. But research and
its reporting are also social acts that require you to think steadily about how
your work relates to your readers, about the responsibility you have not just
toward your subject and yourself, but toward them as well, especially when
you believe that you have something to say that is important enough to cause
readers to change their lives by changing what and how they think.
