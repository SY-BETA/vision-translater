Book I
SKYWALKER STRIKES
It is a period of renewed hope for the
Rebellion.
The evil Galactic Empire's greatest
weapon, the Death Star, has been
destroyed by the young Rebel pilot, Luke
Skywalker.
With the Imperial Forces in disarray, the
Rebels look to press their advantage by
unleashing a daring offensive throughout
the far reaches of space, hoping to defeat
the Empire once and for all and at last
restore freedom to the galaxy.
