Digital Networks and the Culture
of the Autonomy: Introduction
to the 2013 Edition
The core argument presented in this book is that power relationships, the
foundation of the institutions that organize society, are largely constructed
in people's minds through communication processes. The shaping of minds
is a more decisive and lasting form of domination than the submission
of bodies by intimidation or violence. Communication practices include
interpersonal communication and mediated communication. At the societal
scale, it is mediated communication that constitutes the symbolic environ-

meaning in their lives. The dynamics and effects of mediated commu-

communication systems. Therefore, the transformation of communication
by the advent of digital communication, and the associated changes in
organization and culture, have deeply modified the ways in which power
relationships operate, an argument that is consistent with the evidence
gathered in this book.
The transformation of communication in the digital age
The most important communication transformation in recent years has
been the shift of mass communication to mass self-communication, mass
self-communication being the process of interactive communication that
can potentially reach a mass audience, but in which the production of
the message is self-generated, the retrieval of messages is self-directed,
and the reception and remixing of content from electronic communication
networks is self-selected. Organizationally, the rise of one-directional mass
communication, epitomized by traditional television networks, was associ-ated
with the emergence of major business conglomerates. Instead, mass
