Chapter One
The Shrine of Tsukihi
I am God of Origin, God in Truth. There is causality
in this Residence. At this time I have descended
here to save all humankind. I wish to receive Miki
as the Shrine of God.
With these words, spoken in a voice full of divine majesty, the
whole house seemed to become permeated with a spiritual
presence. No one dared to raise their head, neither Zenbei, head
of the family, nor his relatives, nor even Ichibei, an ascetic
monk. Indeed it was a god they had never heard of and a strange
revelation they had never dreamed of. Zenbei did not under-
stand the revelation at first, but upon reflection he realized
that this revelation was truly a serious matter for the
Nakayama family and was most unlikely to be accepted by
them. While he was considering the matter in this way, he
suddenly recalled a series of strange events that had occurred
since the winter of the previous year.
It was on October 26, 1837, when his eldest son, Shuji,
seventeen,' felt a sudden pain in his left leg while he was sowing
barley in the fields, along with his mother, Miki. The pain was
1. Ages given in this book conform to the traditional Japanese system of
calculation, whereby a child was considered to be one year old during
the year of its birth and, thereafter, one year was added to its age on
each New Year's Day. Thus, an infant born on the last day of December
would be two years old the next day.
