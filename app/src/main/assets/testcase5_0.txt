Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
Alice's Right Foot, Esq.
Hearthrug,
near the Fender,
(with Alice's love).
Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!"
Just at this moment her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact
she was now rather more than nine feet high, and she at once took
little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.
Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to
look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more
hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.
"You ought to be ashamed of yourself," said Alice, “a great girl like
you," (she might well say this), "to go on crying in this way! Stop this
moment, I tell you!" But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of
tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches deep,
and reaching half down the hall.
After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and she
hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit
returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid-gloves in one hand
and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great hurry,
muttering to himself, as he came, "Oh! The Duchess, the Duchess! Oh!
Wo'n't she be savage if I've kept her waiting!" Alice felt so desperate that
she was ready to ask help of any one: so, when the Rabbit came near her,
she began, in a low, timid voice, "If you please, Sir-" The Rabbit
started violently, dropped the white kid-gloves and the fan, and skurried
away into the darkness as hard as he could
Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept
fanning herself all the time she went on talking. “Dear, dear! How queer
the
go.
